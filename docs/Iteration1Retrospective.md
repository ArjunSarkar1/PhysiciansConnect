# Team Retrospective – PhysicianConnect (Iteration 1)

**Date:** May 22nd 2025

### Attended Members
Mohammad Mujahidul Islam, Arjun Sarkar, Gagandeep Dolla, Ibrahim Mamman, Pankaj Jhanji

### Brief Overview
As a group, we have gone through many trials and errors of Iteration 1 and learned many things while figuring it out as we went along. We worked to understand the how and why we have each encountered issues, made incremental repairs, and improved our processes, processes like branching and version control. It wasn’t fabulous, but it was productive. Each mistake was an opportunity for us to improve our teamwork and workflow, and we are now better off moving forward.

### Start
- Focus on discussing major changes, doing problematic code together, and debugging/commenting
- Consistently update/assign tasks for each issue
- Ask for assistance immediately to prevent future hiccups

### Stop
- Postponing testing till the last minute prior to pushing changes to main branch

### Continue
- Speaking clearly during team meetings to address urgent concerns regarding assigned duties, primary focus, next steps and further assistance
- Progress check-ins (regular team meetings)

### Actionable Steps
- Online meeting → Duration: 10 - 30 min online every 2 days
- In person meeting → Duration: 20 min - 1hr every 3 days
- Keep tracking (upcoming) features/user stories in Gitlab

### Extra Notes
- Do major stuff (creating files, implementations) of your branch, mention in group chat and push to an integration branch, create merge requests if needed.
- In this way, we have a snapshot of a previous state, and always keep the main/iteration-x branch updated and ready for pulling/pushing. 
- Minor changes just do directly in the main/iteration-x branch
